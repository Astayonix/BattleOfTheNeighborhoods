Being spolied for choice is a double-edged sword though.  In the face of so many options, people are often not happy with the choices that they make experiencing either buyer's remorse (fear of missing out aka FOMO) or being completely overwhelmed leading to analysis paralysis (AP).  My project (I Don't Know - Where Do You Want to Eat) aims to help lunch buddies solve the paradox of choice by implmeneting a hybrid recommender system (both content and collaborative filtering) to help find restaurants that meet the group's dining preferences and offering them 3 options that are close to their central location (the lunch buddies don't have to be at the same location).  The locations of the participants will be used to create a centroid (central location) between them that will be used in conjunction with queries the FourSquare API to return candidate restaurants fitting the top criteria of the diners.  I will then use the matrix factorization techique to create a sparse matrix that I will then feed to a LightFM model to fill in any blanks in the utilization matrix so that the top 3 recommendations can be returned and visualized.",
